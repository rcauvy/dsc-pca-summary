    "The key takeaways from this section include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* PCA is an _unsupervised learning technique_ which does not require labeled data \n",
    "* It is also a dimensionality reduction technique which can be used to compress data and experiment with its effects on machine learning algorithms as a preprocessing step \n",
    "* There are four steps to conducting PCA:\n",
    "    * Center each feature by subtracting the feature mean\n",
    "    * Calculate the covariance matrix for your normalized dataset\n",
    "    * Calculate the eigenvectors/eigenvalues for the covariance matrix\n",
    "        * Reorder your eigenvectors based on their accompanying eigenvalues (in descending order of the eigenvalues)\n",
    "    * Take the dot product of the transpose of the eigenvectors with the transpose of the normalized data\n",
    "* You can also easily implement PCA using scikit-learn "
